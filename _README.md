# Argon Pro for Jekyll - Instructions

This theme is a collaboration between [Creative Tim](https://creative-tim.com) and [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllthemes.io).

This readme file covers all of the **Jekyll-specific features** only. If you need help with using the Argon design system itself, you should visit the [documentation page](https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system/docs/getting-started/overview.html) or [contact the Creative Tim team](https://www.creative-tim.com/contact-us) for support.

## Getting Started

Copy the theme files to your website directory.

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory in your terminal and run `bundle install` to install the theme's dependencies. Then run `jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

If you're not familiar with how Jekyll works, check out [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) for all the details, or read up on just the basics of [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), [writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/), and [creating pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).

## Customizing the theme

This theme can be adapted to suit your needs...

### The `_config.yml` file

You'll need to change:

- site: Change this to your website's name
- url: The full URL that your site will be hosted at, e.g. https://your-domain.com
- baseurl: Add a base URL here if you will be publishing the site inside a folder, e.g. https://your-domain.com/project/ â€“ or if you're hosting it as a 'project page' on GitHub Pages. Example: `baseurl: /project`
- paginate: Change this to set the number of blog posts on each page. If you are using the blog grid styles, this is best in multiples of 3.

When using baseurl, you should reference images in your post/project Frontmatter **without** the baseurl, e.g. `/images/image.jpg` but images inside the Markdown content **should include** the baseurl snippet, e.g. `{{site.baseurl}}/images/image.jpg`

You can also change more advanced things here like the path names, collections etc. You do not need to change any of these to achieve the same look as the demo, so best to leave everything else unless you are confident.

### The `settings.yml` file

You'll find this inside the `_data` folder â€“ this is where you can set all of the theme options.

**Basic settings**

`site_title` â€“ change this to your website's title. This shows up in the browser's title bar, and in the header and footer.
`favicon_image` â€“ change this to the location of your favicon image, which shows up in the browser's title bar.

**Header settings**

`logo_image` â€“ if you'd like to use a logo instead of plain text title in your header, enter the link to it here.
`theme` â€“ choose a color for your header [blue, dark, light]

**Blog settings**

`theme` â€“ choose a format for your blog listings [basic, narrow, grid]
`read_more` â€“ display a narrow grid of other blog posts after each blog [yes, no]

**Menu settings**

This allows you to set the links inside your menu. Add each one as a list item with a `title` and `url`. When hosting on GitHub Pages, make sure you leave a trailing `/` at the end of links to category pages (e.g. `/blog/` or `/projects/`).

**Footer settings**

`footer_tagline` â€“Â sets the text that displays on the left hand side of the footer.

**Contact settings**

The theme comes with a pre-made contact form that you can use with [Formspree](https://formspree.io/create/jekyllthemes), which is free for up to 50 submissions per month. They also have two great paid plans that offer advanced features. Use the link above to set up your account and then paste the 'endpoint' integration code into the theme settings:

`form_action` â€“ this is the form endpoint attribute that you get from FormSpree, for example `https://formspree.io/abcdefgh`
`confirmation_url` â€“ by default the user is shown a default Formspree thank you page. If you have a premium plan, you can use this setting to provide an alternative URL for that page, for example `/thanks` â€“ we have included a basic thank you page with the theme.
`email_subject` â€“ choose the subject of the email you receive from Formspree.
`send_button_text` â€“Â change the text used on the form submit button.

Hint: you can add the contact form to any page of your site using the include â€“ `{% include contact-form.html %}` â€“ for example if you wanted to have the contact form on your About page.

**Social settings**

Here you can add links to your profiles on social networks, and they'll be shown in the footer. Simply add your URL next to the ones you want to show.

**Author settings**

If you are using the basic blog theme, you can add display author information in the list of posts.

Make sure the name of the author of the post matches the author name field exactly in settings.yml.

**Advanced options**

`analytics_code` â€“ use this option to add your Google Analytics code.
`header_js` â€“ use this option to insert javascript into the header of the page.
`footer_js` â€“ use this option to insert javascript at the end of the page.

### Images

Inside the `/assets/img/` folder you'll find a few images included with the theme.

`favicon.png` â€“ you should replace this with the favicon image you'd like to use for your website.

## Main pages

The theme comes with some pages set up ready for your content.

#### Home â€“ `/index.html`

This is your website home page. You can edit some details in the Front Matter at the top of the page:

- `title` â€“ this sets the page title, which shows up in the browser's title bar and on search engine results, social shares etc.
- `description` â€“ this sets the page meta description, which shows up on search engine results, social shares etc.
- `featured_image` â€“ this sets the header image for the page, as well as the meta image, which shows up on social shares.

Below the Front Matter is the code for the page. We've included an example, but you can replace this with your own text content written in markdown.

If you want to add some pre-made sections, such as a pricing table, carousel of team members, or an accordion, following the steps below:

1. Find the component you like in `_includes/component`
2. Add it to index.html by typing `{% include components/pricing/pricing-1.html %}` replacing `/pricing/pricing-1.html` with your desired component

#### Blog â€“ `/blog/index.html`

This is the blog listing page, which shows all your blog posts. You can edit the same things as on the home page to customise it for your website.

#### Sample Content and Other Pages

We have included some example pages in `_pages` to help you get started and easily see how the included components are displayed.  

You may delete them or modify them to suit your needs.  You can edit some details in the Front Matter at the top of the page:

- `title` â€“ this sets the page title, which shows up in the browser's title bar and on search engine results, social shares etc.
- `subtitle` â€“ this sets the page title, which displays below the title in the header
- `description` â€“ this sets the page meta description, which shows up on search engine results, social shares etc.
- `featured_image` â€“ this sets the header image for the page, as well as the meta image, which shows up on social shares.
- `layout` â€“ this sets the layout for the page. You can choose from page-heading, no-page-heading or page. Page-heading shows a banner, no-page-header has no heading at all and page has a simple text heading.

Below the Front Matter is the code for the page. We've included all of the components built into the theme as an example, but you can replace this with your own text content written in markdown.

If you want to add some pre-made sections, such as a pricing table, carousel of team members, or an accordion, following the steps below:

1. Find the component you like in `_includes/component`
2. Add it to index.html by typing `{% include components/pricing/pricing-1.html %}` replacing `/pricing/pricing-1.html` with your desired component

#### Modify components with your content

If you want to modify these components, we recommend the workflow below:

1. Find the component you like in `_includes/component`
2. Duplicate it and rename it
3. Add it to your page by typing `{% include components/pricing/pricing-1.html %}` replacing `/pricing/pricing-1.html` with your renamed component
